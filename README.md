# NSS Exercise | Javascript (Alphastacker)

## Description
For this exercise we were tasked to create a function that should console.log rows of letters.
  ```
  a
  ab
  abc
  etc ...
  ```
Then we were to add logic to the funciton so that it places a space after every fifth letter.
  ```
  a
  ab
  abc
  abcd
  abcde
  abdce f
  abcde fg
  etc ...
  ```

## How to Run
1. Clone repo to your local computer
2. In your terminal be sure you are in this downloaded directory
3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser (preferably Google Chrome) and open the dev tools
5. In the console, you will see the function run
